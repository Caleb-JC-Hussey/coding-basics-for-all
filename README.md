# coding-basics-for-all

A coding course that will hopefully help someone make a thing on their potato.

Now, if you're new, you might wonder "Where do I start?". Well, the first step
is to know what a computer actually is. This may sound condecsending, but it's
really not. There are people who fight over this concept every day. Just so that
I don't screw this up, I will refer you to people who obviously know much more
than I do.

Did that answer your question?-- Yeah, I did't think so, but it is a good video
to watch anyways. You now have a pretty good idea of what a computer is-- I
think... What was that? You want me to get to the pro haxor skills? Okay, okay!
I understand your frustration. Learning can be rather dull at times, but there's
alot to get through before you we can mash our keyboards at green swirling text
in a dark room while wearing a Guy Fawkes mask (jk, you watch too many fake tv
shows).

The reason I'm raining on everyone's [Code Parade](codeparade.net) is because I
bought into all of the Knight Rider nonsense when I was littler. The first time
I tried to code, I typed "if x=2y then y=" into the Smile Basic terminal on my
DSI. This obviously did not work for several reasons: 0.5x is not a valid
datatype, that's not how computers work, and I thought I was smart. In reality,
coding is alot different. I'm too tired to continue writing for tonight, but
I'll just mash my head against my keyboard a bit more tommorow. I guess that's
the course intro!
