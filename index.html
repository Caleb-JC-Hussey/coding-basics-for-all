			Now, if you're new, you might wonder "Where do I start?". Well, the first step
			is to know what a computer actually is. This may sound condecsending, but it's
			really not. There are people who fight over this concept every day. Just so that
			I don't screw this up, I will refer you to people who obviously know much more
			than I do.

			Did that answer your question?-- Yeah, I did't think so, but it is a good video
			to watch anyways. You now have a pretty good idea of what a computer is-- I
			think... What was that? You want me to get to the pro haxor skills? Okay, okay!
			I understand your frustration. Learning can be rather dull at times, but there's
			alot to get through before you we can mash our keyboards at green swirling text
			in a dark room while wearing a Guy Fawkes mask (jk, you watch too many fake tv
			shows).

			The reason I'm raining on everyone's <a href="https://www.codeparade.net">Code Parade</a> is because I
			bought into all of the Knight Rider nonsense when I was littler. The first time
			I tried to code, I typed <code>if x=2y then y=</code> into the Smile Basic terminal on my
			DSI. This obviously did not work for several reasons: 0.5x is not a valid
			datatype, that's not how computers work, and I thought I was smart. In reality,
			coding is alot different. I'm too tired to continue writing for tonight, but
			I'll just mash my head against my keyboard a bit more tommorow. I guess that's
			the course intro!
